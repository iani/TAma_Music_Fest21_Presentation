2 Abstract
══════════

  The present paper discusses the conceptual background and
  compositional procedure for "Contrasts: Tokyo Walks" (short: CTW), a
  locative sound art piece prepared for the for the series of locative
  music concerts entitled "Walking: Spatial Musical Instrument Concerts
  2020" (「あるく！空間楽器コンサート 2020, "Aruku! Kūkan Gakki Konsāto
  2020").  It focusses on two aspects of the "Sonic Walk" project which
  provided the platform for the creation of the piece: (a) Spatial
  distribution of sound objects on a map viewed as compositional score
  to be performed through movement of the audience, and (b) concepts
  from acoustic ecology and culture theory that guided the choice and
  arrangement of sounds in the piece.  It outlines some ideas from
  culture theory and musical theory which influenced the development of
  the piece, giving examples from previous works which deal with these
  concepts, and discussing how these guided the choice and arrangement
  of sounds in the piece.


3 Sonic Walk software as spatial musical instrument
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

  The "Aruku" concerts series were organized by Furukawa lab, directed
  by Prof. Kiyoshi Furukawa of Tokyo University of the Arts, and were
  created and performed entirely on the new platform for interactive
  geolocative sound art created by Furukawa lab. This platform forms the
  core of the "Sonic Walk" project of Furukawa labs and belongs to a
  category of tools for interactive sound works using interactive online
  maps as main medium.  A distinctive characteristic in the project at
  Furukawa lab is that it treats the interactive locative medium as
  musical instrument, that is as a tool that can be used by composers to
  make music which is then experienced independently by members of the
  audience using the platform.  In this sense, the placement of a
  collection of sounds on the map constitutes a musical score.  Thus, in
  the Sonic Walk project, each member of the audience is a musician that
  interprets the geo-locative score by perambulating in the area of the
  map either in real space or virtually on the screen of the device used
  for the piece.  This represents a radical departure from the
  traditional concept of score as notation of events to be played in a
  fixed time sequence. While experiments with non-linear scores abound,
  the locative maps-based approach differs in that it relies on the
  spatial dimension and the individual listener's actions for its
  realization.  Spatial distribution thus forms a basic element in the
  formal language of pieces of the "Sonic Walk" project.

  The idea for the spatial organization of sounds in CTW was derived
  from a previous work of mine: Sands of Time (2004). It is a kinetic
  sound art installation made in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Hebert,
  using a plotter driving a metal ball to draw geometric patterns on
  sand.  For this piece, I chose Schoenberg's model of harmonic regions
  as a pattern for arranging tones on the 2-dimensional plane, so that
  the ball moving on that plane would produce a sequence of tones
  emulating the movement of chords along the plane of Schoneberg's
  harmonic regions.

  A further influence on the design of the piece was research on neural
  networks in harmonic analysis (Marc Leman 1996).  I tried to model the
  idea of activation spreading between nodes in a network directly by
  scaling the amplitude of adjacent nodes in the grid of tones in
  inverse ratio to their distance from the position of the ball on the
  drawing table.  This enabled me to enrich the sound palette of the
  installation by juxtposing two contrasting types of textures in
  different areas of the table, namely percussive sounds on single
  pitches vs. smooth textures on chords.  Here is an extract from the
  Sands of Time:

  In contrast to the straightforward rectangular area which formed the
  spatial framework for "Sands of Time", the sound recordings for CTW
  had an irregular layout which derived from my spontaneous sound walk
  along the northwestern perimeter of Tokyo University Campus and around
  Shinobazu Pond.  From a total of more than 2 hours of recordings, I
  selected 15 sound samples, resulting in the following layout on the
  map:

  The urban Environment of Tokyo is particularly rich in contrasts
  between artificial and natural sounds.  The experience of differences
  and contrasts between sounds which are easily overlooked when walking
  through an urban environment becomes magnified when listening to
  recorded sounds which constitute snapshots of characteristic moments
  and have a prominent spectral or structural sonic profile.  When
  referring to the contrast between sounds produced by humans and
  machines, and those produced by insects, birds and the wind reminded
  me of the concepts of Biophony and Anthropophony from Bernie Krause's
  Acoustic Niche Hypothesis in Acoustic Ecology.  In the process leading
  up to CTW, I drew from the experience of an earlier experiment on a
  similar theme.  This was entitled Rhythmanalysis, inspired by the
  analysis of rhythm in the experience of urban space in the synonymous
  work of Henri Levebvre. Written for a project dealing with the
  Migration crisis in the Eastern Mediterranean in the early 2010's,
  this piece attempted a speculative recreation of the coexistence of
  animal species from remote and contrasting domains, namely swallows
  recorded by myself in Corfu and Wedell Sea Seals from Antarctica from
  the Macauley library of Natural Sounds at Cornell.  Here are 2
  excerpts, the beginning of the piece, and the clash-like climax at 6-7
  minutes.

  The ambience along Tokyo Campus perimeter and Shinobazu Pond is
  conveyed in the piece through sounds recorded at timepoints during the
  day purposely selected to intensify the characteristic ambience of
  each location. The inherent musical potential of these sounds becomes
  apparent as the listener navigates between the locations paying
  attention to their different sonic profiles.  The samples selected
  are:


3.1 kiiroi
──────────

  "Kiiroi" contains the call of a boy calling out "kiiroi" (yellow) at
  the street crossing of kototoi dori and hongo dori, to indicate to his
  companions that the street light has gone yellow. This marks the
  beginning of the sound walk.


3.2 bird_crickets
─────────────────

  Along Kototoi Dori: lots of passers-by, steps on road, bicycle,
  voices, isolated bird-like cricket call, insects, static noise from
  electrical cables.


3.3 cricket_ff
──────────────

  At Kototoi Dori, under bridge between Yayoi Campus and Engineering
  Campus.  This section contains the loudest insect sounds, shrill
  cricket sounds, mixed with loud hum from electrical cables and
  transformers.


3.4 loud_crickets
─────────────────

  Still along Kototoi Dori, loud, disruptive passage of cars, mixing in
  with the sounds of crickets and electrical cables.


3.5 crickets
────────────

  Cricket sounds, with distinct single cricket calling out at
  intermittent intervals.


3.6 echo_crickets
─────────────────

  Chorus of crickets, interspersed with rhythmic calls, from the region
  just after the Yayoi gate of the campus.  The concentration of insects
  is higher here because of the trees around the perimeter of the
  campus, and the sounds reflect off the walls creating echoes.


3.7 cricket_taps
────────────────

  In the vicinity of a vending machine, a more low pitched rhythmic
  cricket call.


3.8 hanbaiki
────────────

  Closeup of the sound of the vending machine (brief excerpt).


3.9 crossing
────────────

  At the crossing to the perimeter path of Shinobazu pond, brief
  screetching of car breaking at the crossing signal, and alternation of
  car noises with softer background ambience from the pond region.


3.10 lake_plane
───────────────

  Walking on the path along the pond, the tranquil atmosphere of the
  waters is overwhelmed by sounds of helicopters and airplanes flying
  overhead and of cars on the road by the path. The crickets' calls
  become more audible towards the end.


3.11 melodic_road
─────────────────

  On the path between the perimeter and the temple, the car sounds
  recede to the background, the insect calls become more prominent and
  melodic, and are iterspersed with steps and talk of passers-by.


3.12 rough_steps
────────────────

  Still on the path between the perimeter and the temple, approaching
  the temple: Alternating steps of passers-by and cricket calls.


3.13 sweet_crickets
───────────────────

  At the other side of perimeter path of Shinobazu pond, the crickets
  posess the night atmosphere, as much as is possible in a busy city
  centre. Children talking in the distance.


3.14 pilgrims
─────────────

  "pilgrims" is the final sample, marking the end of the walk.  It
  contains the loud high-pitched sounds of insects mixed with the steps
  and dialogue of two chinese women visiting the temple to pay their
  respects to the effigy of Ugajin (宇賀神) at the entrance.


4 Conclusion
════════════

  This was a first experiment with Sonic Walk as a compositional tool
  and instrument.  I wanted to see how a soundscape is re-created from
  the original recordings using the online maps as instrument.  The
  treatment of sounds was thus limited to selection of samples, and
  minimal processing to make looping possible.  An interesting outcome
  was the unepected emergence of a narrative from the sounds, when
  listening to them in sequence while paying analytic attention to the
  details.  A reference to the modes of listening of Pierre Schaeffer
  suggests itself for future work.  A further item included in the
  future work agenda is a more musical re-composition of the soundscape
  involving processing of the recordings based on the narrative.


5 Epilogue
══════════

  Walking in an unfamiliar city is like being in a labyrinth.  In that
  sense, the myth of the Labyrinth may well be one of the early myths
  dealing with the creation of the first cities, and the transition to
  complex civilized societies, as also suggested by its association with
  its constructor Daidalos as the primordial architect/engineer.  At the
  same time, both the myth and archaeological evidence suggests early
  associations between technologies of navigation and the construction
  of mental virtual space models.  In that sense, ancient Labyrinths,
  modern online Maps, and interactive soundscapes are all connected to
  primordial civilizational themes of virtual worlds as central notions
  interconnection technology and civilization.

  Claude Shannon's with his Theseus project: A mouse learns to traverse
  a Labyrinth, as an early experiment in Artificial Intelligence.
